# Introduction to All Rings Repository

This repository has been made to help developers of All Rings.

In this repository will be stored scripts from the game, files of any type and more. Also why not the whole project?

## The branches

Since this repository has been made to contain not only the whole project but also other files (without giving the 
specific location of each file in the project) we will use the branches to separate file types, project branch, scripts
and so on...

The whole list of branches is this:
 - [animations](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/animations)
 - [ideas](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/ideas)
 - [images](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/images)
 - [intro](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/intro)
 - [how_to](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/how_to)
 - [project](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/project)
 - [scripts](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/scripts)
 - [sounds](https://github.com/nicolacanzonieri/all_rings/tree/sounds)
